**C Project Template**

This is a basic template for a C project. It includes common directory structure and some essential files to get you started.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a C compiler and build tools installed (e.g., GCC, Clang, Make).
2. **Building the Project:** The build process might depend on the presence of `build.zig` or `Makefile`. Refer to those files for specific instructions (if applicable). Otherwise, you can typically compile individual source files using your C compiler and linker to create an executable.

**Customization:**

- Replace placeholders in the code with your specific project details.
- Add new files and directories as needed for your project's requirements.
- Consider using version control systems like Git for managing code changes.
